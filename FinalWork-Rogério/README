In the directory "Trabalho - Passos 2.1, 4 e 5 -  Diagramas e Gráficos", it is necessary to have a folder named "ssps" with just the SSPs files used, which are found in "Trabalho - Passos 2.1, 4 e 5 -  Diagramas e Gráficos/PACCE".

In the directory "Trabalho - Passo 6", it is also necessary to have this same "ssps" folder.

I haven't uploaded these "ssps" folders because I would be uploading the same files repeated times.
